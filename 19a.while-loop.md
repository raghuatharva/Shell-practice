# Understanding while loop
example:

 while IFS="" read -r file 
do
    echo "Deleting file: $file"
    rm -rf $file
done <<< $FILES

```
1. while , by nature takes one file at a time.
2. Here we are giving it a list of files to consider from FILES=find ${SOURCE_DIR} -name "*.log" -mtime +$DAYS
3. if source dir. has 3 files like 1.log , 2.log , 3.log ; while loop will take one file at a time 
4. what to do with that one file is defined in the do block.
5. here we assigned to do echo the file name and delete it.
6. once the first file is done, it will take the next file and repeat the process.

### **Example 3: Read and print process lines (limit to 3)**

```bash
ps -ef | head -n 3 | while read -r line
do
  echo "Process Line: $line"
done
```

🖥️ Sample Output:
```
Process Line: UID   PID  PPID   C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
Process Line: root     1     0  0 Mar27 ?        00:00:05 /sbin/init
Process Line: root     2     0  0 Mar27 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
